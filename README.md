<h2>Welcome to the ANYOLA Project. A one of its kind learning plattform.</h2>

---
## Description of the repository
The repository on hands is threefold indicated by the three folders in the root directory:
- The frontend folder contains the necessary code to run our demo application
- The backend folder contains a very basic setup for a Flask backend which will be used in the future. It is NOT necessary for the demo purpose.
- The game contains a subtask of the learning platform (Task 6 of the Amelia learn project) following a gamified learning approach. In the future this may be implemented within the frontend framework.

```
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn start
